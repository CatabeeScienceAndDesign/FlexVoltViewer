FlexVoltViewer
==============

FlexVoltViewer version 1.1 is the visualization and interaction app for use with FlexVolt Biosensors.  

See www.flexvoltbiosensor.com for more details about the sensors.

This app is written in Processing, but I am not fully against converting to something like QT or Java, or something else entirely if I see a good case for making the switch.
