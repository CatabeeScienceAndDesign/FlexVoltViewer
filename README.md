FlexVoltViewer
==============

FlexVoltViewer version 1.1 is the visualization and interaction app for use with FlexVolt Biosensors.  

See www.flexvoltbiosensor.com for more details about the sensors.

This app is written in Processing, but I am not fully against converting to something like QT or Java, or something else entirely if I see a good case for making the switch.


To Run The App:  Download the 32-bit version of Processing (www.processing.org) suitable for your operating system.  Open this .pde sketch.  Processing will offer to move the sketch into a folder by the same name (required).


While the app runs in Processing 2.2.1, successful exports to stand-alone executables for Windows OS have only been achieved so far using Processing 2.1.2.  Exports to MAC stand-alones have been successful using 2.2.1 and 2.1.2.  The problem with the Windows exports is traceable to Serial port issues.
