The list of things to do.  

General
- Fix the flashing color/fill/stroke glitches during sampling
- consider a separate thread for incoming data
- drop-down tabs?


Plotting
- make more modular (the upside down y-axis plus offsets make it complicated)

Snake game
- add left/right control using 2 muscle signals

Target game
- add left/right/up/down control using 4 muscle signals
- add toggle between 2 and 4 muscle control
